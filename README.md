# Network-Scanner in Python

Developed a Python-based network scanning tool using the python-Nmap library to automate network scanning and vulnerability scanning. The tool leverages Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, to identify open ports, detect running services, and gather other key information about networked devices, with a focus on security testing and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
